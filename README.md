### How to use

1. First fill out the user name and password in timecard_beta.py file.
2. Make sure you have a working python on you computer. Both Python 2 and Python 3 will work.
3. Use pip to install selenium. You also need a webdriver so that the python can interact with your web browser. Right now, the only working one is Chrome. Go to the link below for more info. https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html
4. Open your terminal type python timecard_beta.py and type the day and the slot
5. You should see a web window pop up and python will take care of the rest job.
6. Enjoy!
